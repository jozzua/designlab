<h1>Letting Grunt Assemble</h1>
<p>I'm at a point where I'm practicing how to build a static website using GruntJS and Assemble.io</p>
<p>I'm reading Brad Frost's <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/using-grunt-with-pattern-lab/">Using Grunt with Pattern Lab</a> and appreciating the concept of atomic design</p>
<p>In essence I'm also trying to build up an atomic design on each of my article. Each is individually designed to stand on it's own.</p>

<blockquote> Gahhh!! Did I learn anything today?!</blockquote>

<p>Flaring my nostrils over the fact that I don't I've gotten anywhere with my practices.  Perhaps I should start simply by autocompleting these darn html tags?</p>
