  <h1>Another Day, Another Code</h1>
  <p>I've been at it learning code this past week. I've even learnd about a cool new JS static site generator called <a href="http://metalsmith.io">metalsmith</a> </p>
  <p>Also discovering I should start really writing my articles in markdown - but that would beat he whole idea of practice coding.</p>
