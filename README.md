# Ramblings on Code and Design

This is a collection of design and user interface related experiments.

It's a collection of daily ramblings on design. What usually happens here:

1. I practice coding in html. I write content and code at the same time.
2. I look for design inspirations that I slowly incorporate into the article.

Each article becomes unique. It's made ground-up in HTML.  What ever happens, happens. If I find like testing something in code - a javascript, an image, a pattern or whatever imagery I see, I'll include.

Needless to say - It's all chaotic.
