  <h1>Another Day, Another Angular Practice Code</h1>
  <p>Still practicing my <a href="http://angularjs.org.">AngularJS</a>
    This time with a little help from <a href="http://gulpjs.com">gulp.js</a>.
   </p> 
   <p>You see, what I did was: </p>
   <ol>
     <li>Installed GulpJS and created a Gulpfile.</li>
     <li>Moved all the files I've previously made in the app folder</li>
     <li>Created a directory listing in JSON format using gulp</li>
     <li>Moved everything updated files into the dist folder</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Now I can make a listing of all the files:</p>
   <ul>
     <li ng-repeat='page in pages'>{{page}}</li>
   </ul>


</body>
