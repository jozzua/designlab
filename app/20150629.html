  <h1>Initial Gulp Setup Done</h1>
  <p>Whew, that took me a while. So what has just happened?</p>
 <p>I've basically created a new root index.html file that lists all the files that are in the app folder.</p>
  <p>And I've also a gulpfile.js that creates a json file of the files, which is accessed in index.html using <a href="http://Angularjs.org">AngularJS.</a>
