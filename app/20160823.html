  <h1>It's indeed been a while</h1>
  <p>My last update here was over a year ago. For some reason I became a bit too busy with work. Will continue my practice sessions though. I've forgotten what I was coding. In my last entry apparently I was playing with Angular JS.  I'll look back at it and see what I'll need to do. </p>
