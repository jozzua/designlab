    <p><span class="initial">T</span>his morning before that I had designed a poster logo for an upcoming crappy robots mini-sumobot tournament. At the same time, I was excited thinking about the movie "Mad Max: Fury Road".  Perhaps it was the thought of crappy robots and machines that made me think of something so 'motorized' as 'Fury Road.'  The feedback for the movie has been great so far.  So why not watch?</p>

    <p>Mika, a graphic designer friend, gave feedback on my initial poster draft when I showed it to her of chat.</p>
    <p>I looked around for for some free sci-fi fonts and found one that I liked (and that seemed to blend very well with the rest of the text.)</p>
