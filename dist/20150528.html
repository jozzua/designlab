    <p>The peeps from Google were there. The sponsors from Accenture was there. The venue organizers from Globe were there.</p>
    <p>Community people.</p>
    <blockquote>"How do you code nowadays?"</blockquote>
    <p>I asked Sophia, the founder of the Philippine Web Designers's Org, as she sat beside me.</p>
    <p>She explained that she used codekit before. Nowadays she uses the sublime text editor.</p>
    <p>I told her about a blog post I read. A designer worked using VIM for a week. He hated it.</p>
    <p>He decided he'll continue giving it a true - for at least a month.</p>
    <p>By the end of the month, he tried to go back to Sublime and couldn't. He had gotten so used to the shortcuts on VIM</p>
