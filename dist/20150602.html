  <h1>An Evening with the Community</h1>:
  <p>You've got to love the local tech community. We all come together just to play and share experiences in organizes events.  What have we learned so far:</p>
  <ul>
    <li id='#planning'>Planning </li>
    <li id='#venues'>Venues and Sponsorships</li>
    <li id='#speakers'>Speakers</li>
  </ul>

  <div id="tab1">
    <p>
    How do you plan for an event? It takes a bit of time. Some orga plan for the whole year to get sponsors early on.  Others plan when we ask users - what do you want to learn?
    </p>

    PWDO has generally tried to do a cold email.  Some other orgs are able to get speakers by getting them a share of the ticket sales.
