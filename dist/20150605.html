  <h1>It's a lovely day</h1>
  <p>I've been studying up on static site generators today.  Looking for which one to use.  There are pros and cons. Jekyll seems to be the leading contender but I was hoping for somethin I could hack into something than can be dynamically created. I was hopeful with Assemble.io because it was purely javascript.</p>
  <p>For now I'm just studying a bit more. Seeing what more I can do.  Eventually I hope to stitch all these articles into one site.  I'll see how far I'll get.</p>
