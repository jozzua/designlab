  <h1>I Missed Practice</h1>
  <p>First, my laptop went down. As in, in broke down and froze while I was in the middle of coding.  Next, I got sick.  I mean, I had some stomach flu that somewhat prevented me from working yesterday.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, I was able to reformat this laptop.</p>
  <p>Yehey!</p>
  <p>Now, back to practice. :)</p>
